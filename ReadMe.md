# Assignment-2

This is a simple TypeScript Express server that serves as a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs. It includes basic setup for routing, middleware, and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js installed on your local machine.
npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed on your local machine.
Basic understanding of TypeScript and Express.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
  npm install
```

## Configuration

Before running the server, you may need to configure certain environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and specify any necessary environment variables there.

Example `.env` file:
PORT=3000

## Run Locally

1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```bash
  npm run build
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
  npm start
```
